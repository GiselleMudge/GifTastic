Giphy API HW Assignment

This is yet another Predator-themed homework attempt. You better start getting used to this, February is still months away.

In this scenario you are a Predator looking for your next trophy. This nifty database has all known apex predators. You can observe how they move after clicking on the buttons to generate an image, and can pause the image by clicking on it again. Here are the instructions on how to use this db:

STEP 1: Click on the buttons provided to research your future trophies. 
STEP 2: Click on the images generated to see them in motion. Click again to stop. Knowledge is power! 
STEP 3: Search for a challenge if these are too easy by entering a keyword in the search form. REPEAT steps 1-3.

Happy hunting!
